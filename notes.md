## 01. Getting Started

### 02. What Is TypeScript & Why Should You Use It

TypeScript is a JavaScript Superset, which means that it is a language that builds up on JavaScript. It adds new features and advantages to it.
But neither browsers nor Node.js can execute TypeScript, so we need to compile it. During compilation features are compiled to JavaScript "workarounds" and possible errors are thrown.
In JavaScript we can use mitigation strategies by using if-checks, validating and sanitizing user input and so on. But this can still result in invalid code.
